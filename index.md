## News
- Revamping of my first year BSc [Web Technology website](https://chauff.github.io/Web-Teaching/) (as part of the Web and Database Technology course) is in full swing. 
- Full paper accepted at RecSys 2020 asking the question *What does BERT know about books, movies and music?* (work led by Gustavo Penha).
- I gave a keynote at [Baltic DB&IS 2020](https://dbis.ttu.ee/) to convince the audience to make BERT their new IR baseline: [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQu5aCFGV_cvTbt8fXMf_CIDPbVjBJdYGSYHbi4D126hO8Zqv6jwrEpQAHGm9uQfIKGxMPpQ1HVkP1P/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)!
- Two full papers accepted at [ECIR 2020](https://ecir2020.org/): one on curriculum learning for IR (led by Gustavo Penha) and one on analyzing BERT with retrieval heuristics (led by Arthur Câmara).
- As of late 2019, I am looking for *MSc thesis students* interested in the topics of **information retrieval** and **natural language processing**!
- Freshly elected member of the ACM SIGIR executive committee, my three-year term starts July 1, 2019!

## My career

For a brief and compact overview, take a look at my 1-page [CV](../documents/Hauff_shortCV.pdf). 

I have been working as staff member (first as Assistant Professor and since 2018 as Associate Professor) at the [Web Information Systems group](http://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/),
 [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl/) since 2013. Between 2011 and 2012 I was a Postdoc in the same group.
I received my PhD in 2010 from the [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/), where I worked in the 
[Human Media Interaction group](http://hmi.ewi.utwente.nl/). 
The [Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg](https://www.uni-magdeburg.de/) in Germany was 
my home during my undergraduate years as a student in computer science.
In the past, I have worked on a variety of topics in the fields of information retrieval & data science, 
including query performance prediction (the topic of [my PhD thesis](../documents/publications/thesis.pdf)), 
social search, computational social science, 
learning to search and IR for specific user groups.

I have diverse research interests and am always happy to dive into a new area. Together with a number of PhD students I am currently focusing on **how to incorporate search into the human learning process at scale**, **collaborative search**, **conversational search** and neural approaches to IR. In 2016 and 2017 I received two prestigious personal grants from the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) with a total funding of more than 1 million euros; this translates into 4-5 PhD/postdoc positions in the developing "search as learning" research area. Take a look at the [Dagstuhl Seminar](https://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=17092) I co-organized on the topic to get an idea of what it is about. TU Delft is a very active provider of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) on the edX platform, which provides a rich experimental playground (many users with actual learning and search needs) for my [Lambda-Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/web-information-systems/projects/lambda-lab/) team. In the past few years, in addition to IR, I have also been active in the area of learning analytics (data science applied to large-scale educational data traces).

In 2018, I gave an invited keynote at the French IR conference [CORIA 2018](https://project.inria.fr/coriataln2018/fr/) on the topic of search as learning:

We do our best in my lab to keep our *one-slide-per-paper* presentation updated (to make this manageable we keep the presentation focused on the past 2-3 years):
